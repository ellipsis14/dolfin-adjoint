This problem is to minimise the compliance

\int_\Omega f*T + \alpha |a|_H1

subject to the Poisson equation with mixed Dirichlet--Neumann conditions:

-div(k(a) \nabla T) = f   on \Omega
                  T = 0   on \delta \Omega_D
    (k(a) \nabla T) = 0   on \delta \Omega_N

and to the control constraints
               0 <= a <= 1
        \int_\Omega a <= V

where T is the temperature, a is the control (a(x) == 1 means material, a(x) == 0 means no material),
f is a prescribed source term (here the constant 10^-2), k(a) = \epsilon + (1 - \epsilon) * a^p with \epsilon
and p prescribed constants, \alpha is a regularisation term, and V is the volume bound on the control.

Physically, this corresponds to finding the material distribution a(x) that produces the
least heat when the amount of high conduction material is limited.

This example demonstrates how to implement general control constraints, and how to use IPOPT
to solve the optimisation problem.
