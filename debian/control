Description: Automatically derive the discrete adjoints of DOLFIN models
 This package automatically derives the discrete adjoint and tangent linear
 models from a forward model written in the python-DOLFIN environment.
 .
 Our approach to automated adjoint derivation relies on run-time annotation of
 the temporal structure of the model, and employs the same finite element form
 compiler to automatically generate the low-level code for the derived models.
 The approach requires only trivial changes to a large class of forward models,
 including complicated time-dependent nonlinear models.
 .
 The adjoint model automatically employs optimal checkpointing schemes to
 mitigate storage requirements for nonlinear models, without any user management
 or intervention. Furthermore, both the tangent linear and adjoint models
 naturally work in parallel, without any need to differentiate through calls to
 MPI or to parse OpenMP directives.
