If you are using Ubuntu, installing dolfin-adjoint is as easy as:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:libadjoint/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dolfin-adjoint

If you are building from source, you will need to install
libadjoint and its python bindings first. The libadjoint
source code is available from http://launchpad.net/libadjoint.

See the INSTALL file of libadjoint for more details. In particular,
the python bindings of libadjoint depend on gccxml (gccxml in Ubuntu,
http://www.gccxml.org).
