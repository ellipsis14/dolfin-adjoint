Installing dolfin-adjoint
*************************

Dependencies
============

Mandatory dependencies:
-----------------------

- FEniCS, version 1.4 or later. For installation instructions for FEniCS/dolfin,
  see their installation instructions.
  [http://fenicsproject.org/download]

- libadjoint. This is a library written in C that manipulates the tape of the
  forward model to derive the associated adjoint equations.
  [http://bitbucket.org/dolfin-adjoint/libadjoint]

Optional dependencies:
----------------------

- SLEPc. This is necessary if you want to conduct generalised stability
  analyses.
  [http://www.grycap.upv.es/slepc/]

- IPOPT and pyipopt: This is the best available open-source optimisation
  algorithm. Strongly recommended if you wish to solve PDE-constrained
  optimisation problems. Make sure to compile IPOPT against the Harwell
  Subroutine Library.
  [https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt]
  [https://github.com/xuy/pyipopt]
  [http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/]

- Moola: A set of optimisation algorithms specifically designed for
  PDE-constrained optimisation problems. Install with `pip install moola`. Note:
  still experimental.

Binary packages
===============

Binary packages are currently available for Ubuntu users through the
launchpad PPA.  To install dolfin-adjoint, do

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-add-repository ppa:libadjoint/ppa
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install python-dolfin-adjoint

which should install the latest stable version on your system.

From source
===========

As dolfin-adjoint is a pure Python module, once its dependencies are
installed the development version can be used without system-wide
installation via

   export PYTHONPATH=<path to dolfin-adjoint>:$PYTHONPATH
